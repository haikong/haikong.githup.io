 *
 * The functions in the architecture specific module implement the IP
 * check sum and 32-bit additions.
 *
 * The IP checksum calculation is the most computationally expensive
 * operation in the TCP/IP stack and it therefore pays off to
 * implement this in efficient assembler. The purpose of the uip-arch
 * module is to let the checksum functions to be implemented in
 * architecture specific assembler.
